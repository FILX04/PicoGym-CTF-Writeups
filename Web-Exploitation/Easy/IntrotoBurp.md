Intro to Burp - PicoCTF Web Exploitation (Easy)
Description
Try using Burp Suite to intercept requests and capture the flag.
Try mangling the request—maybe their server-side code doesn't handle malformed requests very well.

Solution
Step 1: Initial Setup and Observation
🔹 I launched Burp Suite and began analyzing the website at http://titan.picoctf.net:58401.
🔹 The Target tab showed two key paths:

/ (homepage)
/dashboard (restricted area)
🔹 Both GET and POST requests were detected.
Step 2: Reviewing HTTP Requests and Responses
📌 Observations from intercepted traffic:

GET / → Status 200 OK (Page loads normally).
POST / → Status 302 Redirect (Possibly login-related).
GET /dashboard → Status 200 OK (Restricted area, but no useful data).
POST /dashboard → Status 200 OK (Request includes an OTP field).
Step 3: Sending Requests to Repeater
🔸 I sent the /dashboard POST request to Repeater for manual modification.
🔸 The request contained an OTP field, which looked like a one-time password (OTP) check.

Step 4: Manipulating the OTP Field
🔹 First, I changed the OTP to a random number → ❌ "Invalid OTP".
🔹 Then, I replaced the OTP with text → ❌ "Invalid OTP" (Still processed).

Interesting: The server accepted non-numeric input, hinting at poor validation!
Step 5: Exploiting the OTP Bypass
💡 I removed the OTP field entirely and resent the request.
✅ Success! The server responded with the flag 🎉

Key Takeaways
🔹 Burp Suite is essential for analyzing and manipulating HTTP traffic.
🔹 Server-side validation is crucial—poor validation can lead to bypasses!
🔹 Always test input fields, as some may be unnecessary for authentication.
