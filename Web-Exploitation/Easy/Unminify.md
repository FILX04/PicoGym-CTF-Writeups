Unminify - PicoCTF Web Exploitation (Easy)
Description
I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!

📌 Hint:

Try CTRL+U or ⌘+U in your browser to view the page source.
You can also add view-source: before the URL.
Alternatively, use curl <URL> in your shell.
Minification reduces code size but does not change functionality.
Solution
1️⃣ Visit the challenge URL

After launching the challenge instance, I navigated to the provided website.
The page itself didn't reveal anything useful.
2️⃣ Check the Source Code

Since the description mentioned "squished" code, I suspected minification.
I opened the page source using:
CTRL+U (Windows/Linux) or ⌘+U (Mac).
Alternatively, I could have used view-source:<URL> in the browser.
3️⃣ Find the Hidden Comment

Scrolling through the HTML source, I found a comment containing the flag!
This is a common web exploitation technique where important data is hidden in comments.
